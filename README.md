- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ignarts, a young videogame developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming for unity but im always open to learningall kinds of things about programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a career in video game desing in Pamplona, Navarra in Spain.
- 💞️ I would love to be able to start gaining experiencie as a progremmer and I will be uploading and sharing various codes for (especially) videogames. And of course, if someone wants to correct any code that they think can be done in a more optimal way, I will be happy to know and appreciate the constructive criticism.
