- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ignarts, a young videogame developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming for unity but im always open to learning all kinds of things about programming.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm working on Otter's Hell, a 3D Roguelike & Bullet Hell video game protagonized by otters and hamsters
- 💞️ I would love to be able to start gaining experiencie as a progremmer and I will be uploading and sharing various codes for (especially) videogames. And of course, if someone wants to correct any code that they think can be done in a more optimal way, I will be happy to know and appreciate the constructive criticism.
